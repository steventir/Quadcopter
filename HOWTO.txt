First you start with 
ls

Then you go to your directory :
cd Development/Quadcopter		//If you tap Devl (PRESS TAB), it should auto complete the directory path for you

If you have added any files and you want to put in to GitHub, now that you are in the right directory you can do this :

git pull										//that is pulling from the GitHub repository
git add .									// the . is your current directory.	Adding to the local repository
git commit -m " any comment here"  // commiting to the GitHub repository
git push										// pushing to the GitHub repository

Done.
